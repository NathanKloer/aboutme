            <p>
                Hello, my name is Nathan Kloer. I have been coding for
                little over a year. I graduated in feburary from a coding
                bootcamp at Georgia Tech. I work for Quotum Tech as a Front
                End Developer. Before that I worked at Formetco, a digital
                billboard company as a call technician. I have experience
                as a social media content creater for Atlanta Eats, a TV show
                on PeachtreeTV that is based in Atlanta. I created and edited
                video footage to be used on Instagram and Facebook. Check out
                the nav above to browse my site.

                I have a cat named Smudge. He is two years old and was born to my
                roommate's cat, Princess. He loves chasing his tail (pictured above)
                Have you heard Rage Against the Machine is back together! Amazing Band.
                I love films and my favorite movie is Snatch by Guy Ritchie. I've made a Favorite films
                Quiz previously, and you are welcome to
                <a href="https://nathankloer.github.io/TriviaGame/">give it a try!</a>
                The last film I saw was Joker.

                When I feel like video games, I am either playing Leauge of Legends or
                Outer Worlds. I really enjoy playing board games as well and love trying
                new games. I also play Dungeons & Dragons when I can. In the past I used to
                play so much, that I would get my room and ticket to Dragoncon free by running
                games for players that >weekend. My first high level character was a cavalier named "Maliphian".

                Here are some pictures of when I worked on Atlanta Eats as their social media video editor. I learned
                a lot about social media and film from working here.
