                    Hello, my name is Nathan Kloer. I have been coding for
                    little over a year. I graduated in feburary from a coding
                    bootcamp at Georgia Tech. I work for Quotum Tech as a Front
                    End Developer. Before that I worked at Formetco, a digital
                    billboard company as a call technician. I have experience
                    as a social media content creater for Atlanta Eats, a TV show
                    on PeachtreeTV that is based in Atlanta. I created and edited
                    video footage to be used on Instagram and Facebook. Check out
                    the nav above to browse my site.

                    I have a cat named Smudge. He is two years old and was born to my
                    roommate's cat, Princess. He loves chasing his tail (pictured above)
                    My favorite bands right now are Guerilla Toss, Slothrust, and Motherborg.
                    I love films and my favorite movie is Snatch by Guy Ritchie. I've made a Favorite films
                    Quiz previously, and you are welcome to
                    <a href="https://nathankloer.github.io/TriviaGame/">give it a try!</a>
                    I really enjoy the movie theatre experience, and will sometimes go
                    see a movie alone. The last film I saw was Joker.
                    <br><br>
                    When I feel like video games, I am either playing Leauge of Legends or
                    Outer Worlds. I really enjoy playing board games as well and love trying
                    new games. I also play Dungeons & Dragons when I can. In the past I used to
                    play so much, that I would get my room and ticket to Dragoncon free by running 
                    games for players that >weekend. My first high level character was a cavalier named "Maliphian".
